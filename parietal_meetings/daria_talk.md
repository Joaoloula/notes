# Functional Connectivity Analysis on MEG
# Talk by Daria La Rocca

## Introduction to Functional Connectivity

- Information flow in the brain can be seen as as a network

- Methods: 
	-directed or undirected information propagation
	- linear or nonlinear
	- time or frequency domain

FC measure: Phase Lag Index (PLI)

- An assymemtru index for the phase difference distribution

- Invariant with respect to common sources (different from COH)

- wPLI less sensitiv to additional uncorrelated noise

## Main Questions

- Network implicated on a specific perceptual task

- Changes after learning/training

- Specificity of FC in multisensory training

- Correlation to stimulus category

## Perceptual Learning Task


Random Dot Kinematograms (RDK)

## Signal Processing Approach

- Pipeline
	
	- Artifact Correction
 
	- 28 ROI

	- Thresholding to obtain the network topology

	- Permutation task vs. resting state: task specidic coupling/decoupling


## Results

- Alpha Band: significant decoupling only on the MT and visual cortex

- Beta Bands 1 and 2: *huge* increases on significant patterns

- High Gamma band: significant decoupling on the frontal eye field and VLPFC-motor/premotor

## Future Work
